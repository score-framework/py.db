def create_context_factory(cls, member='id', matchkey=None, match_convert=None):
    """
    Creates a :term:`context <pyramid:context>` generating function.
    The function will look for the specified member in the :term:`request
    <pyramid:request>`'s :ref:`matchdict <pyramid:matchdict>`.

    By default, this will create a function that matches the id in a URL, and
    thus allows you to use it somewhat like this:

    >>> config.add_route('article', '/article/{id}',
                         factory=create_context_factory(db.Article))

    It is possible to define a different *member* to use:

    >>> config.add_route('article', '/article/{slug}',
                         factory=create_context_factory(db.Article, 'slug'))

    The function will by default look for a key with the same name as the
    member in the matchdict, but it is possible to provide a different
    *matchkey*:

    >>> config.add_route('article', '/article/{title}',
                         factory=create_context_factory(db.Article, 'slug', 'title'))

    The function will further try to find the correct conversion function, for
    converting the string in the matchdict to the correct type (for example, it
    will convert ``id`` values to integers), but the conversion function can
    be specified explicitly as *match_convert*:

    >>> def match_convert(request, match):
    ...     return datetime(match)
    ...
    >>> config.add_route('article', '/article/{datetime}',
                         factory=create_context_factory(db.Article, 'datetime',

class AutologinAuthenticationPolicy:
    """
    An :term:`authentication policy <pyramid:authentication policy>` that will
    automatically check if a *username* and *password* were submitted and log
    the user in if the credentials match.

    The constructor expects another authentication *backend* (i.e. another
    authentication policy), that will do the actual work, and a *userclass*
    that has the members *username* and *password*. The class is assuming that
    the password member is an
    :class:`sqlalchemy_utils.types.password.PasswordType` and will thus compare
    the POSTed *password* directly.

    Example user class:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sqlalchemy import (
            Column,
            String,
        )
        from sqlalchemy_utils.types.password import PasswordType

        class User(Base):
            username = Column(Integer)
            password = Column(PasswordType(schemes=['pbkdf2_sha512']))
            groups = ('group:knight', 'group:philosopher')

    Example setup:

    .. code-block:: python

        authbase = AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy('spambaconeggsandspam',
                callback=lambda user_id, req: req.user.groups, hashalg='sha512')

        config.set_authentication_policy(auth)
        config.add_request_method(auth.user, 'user', property=True)

        <form method="post">
            <input name="username" />
